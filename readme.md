Crevs' Items mod
================

Basically, it adds items. I guess you could probably tell that much, but that's all it does really.

Also lets you upgrade them, granted you find them and someone to do it. Pretty cool stuff, huh?


Installation
============

The mod's written for BGT and BG(2):EE in mind, and this is on purpose. It runs on EET and BG2:ToB as a side effect more or less.

To install this mod, place the "c7-items" folder in your game's folder containing the "chitin.key" file, and run setup-c7-items.exe or refer to a guide if you're installing on a different platform.


Compatibility
=============

You should install this mod rather early during installation; it's coded in such a way that other mods won't interfere with it, and all I do is add items. Did I mention that, this mod puts new items in your game. Neat.

Other item mods such as Item Revisions (which I'm pretty sure the readme of says this) should be installed afterwards mine because they modify mod-added items, such as mine.


Version Change Log
==================

v0.1:
 - There's nothing here, this mod does not work at all. It's just 3 empty files!!
